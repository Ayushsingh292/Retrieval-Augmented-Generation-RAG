There are several Python-related channels on the libera IRC network.\nAll channels are available by connecting to Internet Relay Chat server Libera.Chat . The #python channel is for all discussion about the Python language,\necosystem, and community. You can get immediate help with programming\nquestions. You will need to first register your nickname with Libera,\nusing the nickname setup instructions ( https://libera.chat/guides/registration ). Spanish speakers can use the #pyar channel, from the Python Argentina user group. French speakers can join the #python-fr channel. Finnish speakers can join the #python.fi channel on a different network, IRCnet . (Note: prior to May 2021, these channels existed on Freenode. Some of them\nwere forcibly removed by Freenode operators, after a change in management and network policy. The channels on Freenode are no longer under the PSF umbrella.) #python-dev is for CPython developers, where they can\ncoordinate their work or discuss problems.  Bots post updates to the channel based on\nactivity in the CPython source tree and bug tracker. #python-infra is for Python infrastructure discussion. #pydotorg is for discussion of this website, python.org. #distutils and #pypa are for Python packaging discussion. IRC clients for many platforms can be found in the Internet Relay Chat (IRC)\nHelp Archive . The Python Software Foundation is the organization behind Python.
